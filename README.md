# GPU Registration Protocol (GRP): Credible Commitment of GPU Ownership and Usage

## Abstract

The GPU Registration Protocol (GRP) aims to establish a decentralized and transparent system for registering GPUs using Ethereum. The GRP protocol leverages blockchain technology and cryptographic techniques to ensure credibility, privacy, and accountability throughout the GPU lifecycle. The protocol involves GPU identity creation, manufacturer and owner registration, proof of existence and ownership, and compliance enforcement. Incentives such as token rewards and regulatory compliance benefits encourage participation, while tamper resistance measures protect against unauthorized tampering. By implementing the GRP protocol, the GPU industry can enhance supply chain management, traceability, and responsible resource usage. It is implemented as a protocol, and not a state-mandated or centralized service, to promote a credibly neutral environment, free from any single party's control or manipulation.
